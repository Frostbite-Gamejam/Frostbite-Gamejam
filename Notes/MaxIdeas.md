# Max's Ideas
Okay so, I've been thinking about how this game should work, and I think I finally came up with a system that allows for the gameplay and the story to be interwoven together with minimal new features.

First of all, I think going for a real "puzzle game" would be very difficult, as pretty much every puzzle I can think up has something to do with a game mechanic that would be overly complex to implement like animals, cameras, water, weight, scientific equipment, etc. While we may be able to include a few puzzles like what people were probably imagining, I think the main portion of our player's in game activity will have to come from something else.

I present to you, my new system that would be the majority of our gameplay. The memory system. This system would require the creation of two new absolutely essential functions.
First, an notebook object that you can interact with and type things into. The notebook also needs to have an answer checking system that unlocks doors when all parts are correctly filled in. Second, mapping a keyboard button to open a menu that displays the player's current knowledge and memories that the have regained (likely sorted by the room the knowledge was obtained in). This menu will be gradually filled in over the course of the game as the player learns new information by interacting with objects and filling in the notebook.

A new notebook would spawn in every room, and be evaporated into thin air when all the answers are correctly filled in. The disappearance of the notebook would also prompt the opening of the door to the next room and the spawning of the next notebook.

The story behind this is that the aliens are trying to learn more about what lead up to the extinction of humanity, but are bad at interpreting his memories, and so they want him to provide them with information. The notebook would ask questions that would help the aliens, and also the player, understand what's going on.

Example questions include things such as
Location:
Subject Name:
Year: (would probably appear in every notebook)

The questions would start out really short and simple because the aliens are bad at speaking English, but they could get longer as the game goes on.

An example of how this could be implemented into the first room (the cave when it is still mostly natural with only some minor surveying being done), which I imagine as a sort of tutorial, would be like this:

Given questions (with eventual answer that must be found)
Year: (1952)
Place: (Ohio)
Enemy: (Soviet Union)

The player would be at the entrance to the cave to start out, and it would be locked. There would be an outdoor table nearby with some random papers and a key on it. The player would receive the following propmt upon taking the key "Even though I'm in the middle of nowhere, there's still all this paperwork lying around. They even bother to keep the place locked behind a gate. I suppose it must be more important than meets the eye". The player would then get a new note added to their memory log that is either a summary of this line or this line verbatim.

If the player looks at the papers some more, they will see a newspaper among them. If the player interacts with the newspaper, the following prompt appears "Oh look a newspaper, lets see if I can get any info on whats going on. Looks like whoever this belonged to spilled their drink on it or something, the only thing I can make out is the year in this headline. 1952. The sad thing is, I have no idea if this year should be reassuring or worrying. I really need to figure out what's going on." Something like this would then be added to the memory log "I found an old newspaper but it was mostly unreadable. All I got out of it was the year, 1952.".

Somewhere in the cave would be some blueprints and a map of the United States with a location in Ohio circled. Either on something like an easal stand, or flattened out on a table. This map would give them the information about where they are (Ohio) followed by a similar text promt then memory log addition like above.

The player could get the enemy (Soviet Union) by reading some Cold War propaganda flyer lying around somewhere (maybe they have to dig through a pile of props to find it or something, just to give the player something to do).

There could also be some other prompts and memory log additions in various places along the map. These would provide additional context and information, but not be completely necessary for the completion of the notebook. This could be something like notes left behind by a surveyor about how blast resistant this cave is (hinting towards it being for a bomb shelter).

As far as how the notebook is filled in, I could see it working several ways and would be fine with any of them depending on what you guys want to do.
1. The player is given a blanks to fill in that gives underscores to indicate how many characters are needed (like _ _ _ _ for Ohio). 
2. Same as above, but important words in the memory log are highlighted red. This method is if we think players will have a hard time choosing the right word.
3. The character will automatically fill it in with any information the player has learned. This is if you don't at all like the idea of filling in information.

Anyway, thanks for reading this loooooong idea post. I hope you find this method of gameplay to be acceptable. Please let me know wat you think of this and whether or not this works for you as the way we should make our game.
